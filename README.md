==================

Custom label view to be used in android as a single entity

This project demonstrates the use of "custom android label".
As seen on iOS and on certain Android devices in applications such as Email/messaging, as soon as the user
selects any recipient from the list appearing when the user types some text, a view gets created 
which contains the selected text, (optionally image) and  cross icon to remove that selected recipient.

Android custom label provides you the custom view which can be directly used in your applications.
It can be modified according to your needs. 
Also one can declare the label in layout files.
